# CV-Reader

The CV is just a simple blueprint of a real one and you'll need create the model as you wish with some details. (work experience, hobbies, Achievements, github link)

When the application starts a menu will be shown and the user will be asked to select one of the following options:

Insert a CV in the database
Read my CV from the database
Get list of CV
Bonus
You can create some filters and only those cvs are returned; e.g: only those who graduated in the last year will be shown; the user has a github link
